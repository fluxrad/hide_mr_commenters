A chrome plugin to hide annoying Marginal Revolution commenters.

## Todo:

- Persistent data store so you can ignore Steve Sailer all the time.
- Add the ability to open single comments as opposed to re-enabling the poster's
  entire thread history

## Disclaimer

This is terrible code and I accept no liability for its use. In all honesty,
it'll probably run over your dog and burn down your house. Void where
prohibited. All rights reserved. It pays to Discover. What's in your wallet?
